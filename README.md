## Overview

**CVProject** is a comprehensive project aimed at processing and analyzing [data type] using state-of-the-art libraries in Python. This project leverages powerful packages such as `librosa` for audio analysis, `numpy` for numerical computations, `scipy` for scientific computing, and `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks. The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook to facilitate interactive exploration, analysis, and visualization.

*Note: Although the project is named "CVProject," parts of it deal with audio processing. If you are primarily interested in computer vision applications, please refer to the respective sections of the notebook or adapt the instructions accordingly.*

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Import and preprocess [audio/image] data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract meaningful features using libraries such as `librosa`.
- **Analysis and Modeling:** Implement machine learning models to analyze the data.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the results of your data analysis to gain insights.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Use Jupyter Notebook for an interactive coding and visualization environment.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Click the copy button below to copy the command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZuhaibUlHassan/CVProject.git
cd CVProject
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Copy the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Unix or MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install the Required Dependencies

The project relies on the following main libraries:
- `librosa`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`
- `numba`
- `soundfile`
- `pooch`

#### Using a requirements.txt File

If you have a `requirements.txt` file, install the dependencies by copying:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Manual Installation

Otherwise, manually install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install librosa numpy scipy scikit-learn joblib numba soundfile pooch
```

## Usage

### Launch Jupyter Notebook

In the project directory, start the Jupyter Notebook server by copying and running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Open the Notebook

Open the `CVProject.ipynb` notebook in your web browser. The notebook is organized into cells that cover:
- Data loading
- Preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model building
- Result visualization

### Run the Notebook

Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis. You can modify parameters or add additional cells to further explore the data.

## Project Structure

The repository includes:

- **CVProject.ipynb:** Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required to run the notebook.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview and instructions.
- **data/** (optional): Folder to store data files if the project uses external datasets.
- **images/** (optional): Folder for any figures or images generated by the analysis.
